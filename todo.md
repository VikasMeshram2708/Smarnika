## TODO

We'll not use realtime db because there is no two way communication happening. Instead we'll use server event to get the realtime sync.

- Use MongoDB
- Sidebar
  - Left side Column Items should be named Collections.
  - Inside collections we'll add new pages.

## Future Features

- [ ] Add rate limiting feature on server actions.

- [x] Add more names in hero section client companies

- [x] Remove the minimum screen height in workspace page

- [x] If im on a private page and i delete that particular page, after the delete logic takes place and it's delete it should redirect to /workspace page.

- [ ] Customize the not found page and add a back button redirecting to the home page.

- [ ] Clipper like feature when enabled we can browse other tabs and a little popover will be there on that tabs when we'll select some content like some paragraphs from a blog post, a youtube video, or an image.

- PWA Support
