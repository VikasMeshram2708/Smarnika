## TODO

We'll not use realtime db because there is no two way communication happening. Instead we'll use server event to get the realtime sync.

- Use MongoDB
- Sidebar
  - Left side Column Items should be named Collections.
  - Inside collections we'll add new pages.

## Future Features

- [ ] Clipper like feature when enabled we can browse other tabs and a little popover will be there on that tabs when we'll select some content like some paragraphs from a blog post, a youtube video, or an image.

- PWA Support
