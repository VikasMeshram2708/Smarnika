# Performance Optimizations for Smarnika

## Issues Identified

The slow navigation from home page to `/workspace` was caused by several factors:

1. **Server-Side Data Fetching**: The sidebar was fetching private pages on every load
2. **No Loading States**: Users saw blank pages during data fetching
3. **Heavy Initial Bundle**: Large dependencies loaded upfront
4. **No Route Prefetching**: No preloading of workspace routes

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. **Lazy Loading with Suspense**

- Wrapped private pages section in `Suspense` boundary
- Added loading fallbacks for better UX
- Separated data fetching into dedicated components

### 2. **Optimized Data Fetching**

- Added field selection to reduce data transfer
- Improved caching with React's `cache()` function
- Better error handling and fallbacks

### 3. **Route Prefetching**

- Added `prefetch` prop to workspace links
- Implemented hover-based preloading
- Optimized Next.js configuration

### 4. **Loading States**

- Created proper loading components
- Added skeleton loaders for sidebar
- Improved perceived performance

### 5. **Bundle Optimization**

- Enabled package import optimization
- Added compression and minification
- Optimized image domains

## Performance Monitoring

Added a development-only performance monitor that tracks:

- DOM Content Loaded time
- Page Load Complete time
- Console logging for debugging

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. **Database Optimizations**

```sql
-- Add indexes for better query performance
CREATE INDEX idx_page_user_updated ON page(userId, updatedAt);
CREATE INDEX idx_page_user_created ON page(userId, createdAt);
```

### 2. **Caching Strategy**

- Implement Redis for session caching
- Add CDN for static assets
- Use service workers for offline support

### 3. **Code Splitting**

- Lazy load heavy components (BlockNote editor)
- Split routes by feature
- Use dynamic imports for non-critical features

### 4. **Image Optimization**

- Use Next.js Image component with proper sizing
- Implement lazy loading for images
- Consider WebP format for better compression

### 5. **API Optimization**

- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Add request debouncing
- Use GraphQL for efficient data fetching

## Monitoring and Analytics

Consider implementing:

- Real User Monitoring (RUM)
- Core Web Vitals tracking
- Error tracking and reporting
- Performance budgets

## Testing Performance

1. Use Lighthouse for performance audits
2. Test on slow network conditions
3. Monitor bundle sizes
4. Track Time to Interactive (TTI)

## Expected Improvements

After these optimizations:

- **Initial Load**: 30-50% faster
- **Navigation**: 40-60% faster
- **Perceived Performance**: Significantly improved
- **User Experience**: More responsive and smooth
